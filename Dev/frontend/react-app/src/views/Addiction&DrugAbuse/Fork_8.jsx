            <Paragraph>
              The Australian Federal Police (AFP) and local law enforcement agencies work hard to reduce the impact of drugs in communities. The country's strict drug control policies aim to protect individuals from falling into addiction.

            <Paragraph>
              By choosing not to act:
            </Paragraph>
            <ul>
              <li>- You risk the safety of others</li>
              <li>- You contribute to the spread of addiction</li>
              <li>- You undermine law enforcement efforts</li>
            </ul>

            <Paragraph>
              Take control of the situation next time by reaching out for helpâ€”because by doing so, you are protecting not only your own future but the well-being of others in your community.

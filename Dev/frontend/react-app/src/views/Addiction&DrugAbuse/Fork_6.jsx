                  Getting caught in a drug deal can have severe repercussions, including:
                </Paragraph>
                <ul>
                  <li>Criminal Charges: You could be charged with possession, intent to distribute, or even trafficking. These charges can result in significant fines, a criminal record, or imprisonment.</li>
                  <li>Permanent Record: A conviction for drug offences in Australia can stay on your record and affect your future opportunitiesâ€”making it harder to find a job, apply for certain visas, or even rent a place to live.</li>
                  <li>Impact on Migration Status: If you're a migrant or hold a temporary visa, drug-related offences can jeopardize your immigration status, leading to potential visa cancellations or deportation.</li>
                </ul>
              </Col>
            </Row>
